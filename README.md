# Face Detection with OpenCV
This is a real-time face detection project using Python and OpenCV.
It uses the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces from your webcam and draws a green rectangle around detected faces.




## Features

- Detects faces in real-time using your webcam.
- Draws a bounding box around the largest face detected to reduce false positives.
- Easy to run and modify for learning purposes.



## Deployment

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV library
- Install dependencies using:

```bash
  pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python

```


## How To Run

1.Clone the repository:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-opencv.git
cd face-detection-opencv

```
2.Make sure your virtual environment is activated (optional):

```bash
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```
3.Run the face detection script:

```bash
python face_rec.py
```
4.Press ESC to exit the webcam window.
